# zirkel-website

This is a website for a personal project organizing training for mathematical olympiads for high school students. It encompasses submissions of students and markings of these submissions by reviewers.

Sadly, I cannot share the mathematical content since parts of the problems are non-public. I am unsure how well this website will work without that. But if you want to set up something similar and have questions, just get in touch with me.
